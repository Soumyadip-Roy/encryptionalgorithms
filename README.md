# Secure Chat App

This is a secure chat application that incorporates Caesar Cipher (ROT13), RSA, and AES encryption algorithms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of chat messages.

## Features

- End-to-End Encryption: All chat messages are encrypted using AES symmetric encryption, ensuring only authorized recipients can decrypt and read the messages.
- Key Exchange: RSA asymmetric encryption is used for secure key exchange between users, allowing the secure establishment of communication channels.
- Message Integrity: Message digests or signatures are generated using hashing algorithms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of chat messages.
